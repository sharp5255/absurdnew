# Absurd News Generator

A simple Python script that generates absurd, yet somewhat plausible, news headlines by combining random words, locations, and actions. Perfect for a bit of fun or creative inspiration!

## Description

The Absurd News Generator creates random headlines by mixing predefined lists of nouns, verbs, locations, and quirky details. You can customize the output by selecting a specific city or style (e.g., serious, comedic, surreal). The script is lightweight, easy to modify, and great for a laugh or as a starting point for more complex projects.

### Features

- Option to specify a custom city (defaults to random if not provided).
- Extensible: add your own words, styles, or rules to tweak the output.
